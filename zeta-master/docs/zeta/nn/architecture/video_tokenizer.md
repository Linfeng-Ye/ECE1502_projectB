## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the documentation for the Zeta library, with a focus on the `VideoTokenizer` class. This comprehensive guide provides in-depth information about the Zeta library and its core components. Before we dive into the details, it's crucial to understand the purpose and significance of this library.

### 1.1 Purpose

The Zeta library aims to simplify deep learning model development by offering modular components and utilities. One of the essential components is the `VideoTokenizer` class, which serves various purposes, including video encoding, decoding, and quantization.

### 1.2 Key Features

- **Video Processing:** The `VideoTokenizer` class allows you to encode and decode video data efficiently.

- **Lookup-Free Quantization:** Zeta incorporates lookup-free quantization techniques to improve the quality of encoded video tokens.

## 2. VideoTokenizer Class <a name="video-tokenizer-class"></a>

The `VideoTokenizer` class is a fundamental module in the Zeta library, enabling various video processing tasks, including encoding, decoding, and quantization.

### 2.1 Initialization Parameters <a name="initialization-parameters"></a>

Here are the initialization parameters for the `VideoTokenizer` class:

- `layers` (Tuple[Tuple[str, int]]): A tuple of tuples defining the layers and their dimensions in the network.

- `residual_conv_kernel_size` (int): The kernel size for residual convolutions.

- `num_codebooks` (int): The number of codebooks to use for quantization.

- `codebook_size` (int): The size of each codebook for quantization.

- `channels` (int): The number of channels in the input video.

- `init_dim` (int): The initial dimension of the video data.

- `input_conv_kernel_size` (Tuple[int, int, int]): The kernel size for the input convolution operation.

- `output_conv_kernel_size` (Tuple[int, int, int]): The kernel size for the output convolution operation.

- `pad_mode` (str): The padding mode for convolution operations.

- `lfq_entropy_loss_weight` (float): The weight for the entropy loss during quantization.

- `lfq_diversity_gamma` (float): The gamma value for diversity loss during quantization.

### 2.2 Methods

The `VideoTokenizer` class provides the following methods:

- `encode(video: Tensor, quantize=False)`: Encode video data into tokens. You can choose whether to quantize the tokens by setting `quantize` to `True`.

- `decode(codes: Tensor)`: Decode tokens back into video data.

- `forward(video, video_or_images: Tensor, return_loss=False, return_codes=False)`: Perform a forward pass through the video tokenizer. This method supports various options, including returning loss and codes.

## 3. Functionality and Usage <a name="functionality-and-usage"></a>

Let's explore the functionality and usage of the `VideoTokenizer` class.

### 3.1 Encode Method <a name="encode-method"></a>

The `encode` method takes video data as input and encodes it into tokens. You can choose whether or not to quantize the tokens by setting the `quantize` parameter to `True`.

### 3.2 Decode Method <a name="decode-method"></a>

The `decode` method takes tokens as input and decodes them back into video data.

### 3.3 Forward Method <a name="forward-method"></a>

The `forward` method performs a complete forward pass through the video tokenizer. It accepts video data and various options, including returning loss and codes.

## 4. Examples <a name="examples"></a>

Let's dive into practical examples to demonstrate the usage of the `VideoTokenizer` class.

### 4.1 Example 1: Creating a VideoTokenizer <a name="example-1-creating-a-videotokenizer"></a>

In this example, we create an instance of the `VideoTokenizer` class with default settings:

```python
video_tokenizer = VideoTokenizer()
```

### 4.2 Example 2: Encoding and Decoding Videos <a name="example-2-encoding-and-decoding-videos"></a>

Here, we demonstrate how to use the `VideoTokenizer` to encode and decode video data:

```python
video = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32, 32)  # Example video data
encoded_tokens = video_tokenizer.encode(video, quantize=True)
decoded_video = video_tokenizer.decode(encoded_tokens)
```

### 4.3 Example 3: Forward Pass with Loss Calculation <a name="example-3-forward-pass-with-loss-calculation"></a>

In this example, we perform a forward pass through the video tokenizer and calculate the loss:

```python
video = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32, 32)  # Example video data
video_or_images = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32, 32)  # Example input for forward pass
loss, loss_breakdown = video_tokenizer(video, video_or_images, return_loss=True)
```

## 5. Additional Information <a name="additional-information"></a>

Here are some additional tips and information for using the Zeta library and the `VideoTokenizer` class effectively:

- Experiment with different layer configurations in the `layers` parameter to tailor the network architecture to your specific task.

- The `quantize` parameter in the `encode` method allows you to control whether you want to perform quantization during encoding. Set it to `True` for quantization.

- Explore the impact of `lfq_entropy_loss_weight` and `lfq_diversity_gamma` on the quality of quantized tokens when initializing the `VideoTokenizer` class.
