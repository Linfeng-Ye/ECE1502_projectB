## Module/Class Name: DynamicRoutingBlock
### Overview
The `DynamicRoutingBlock` class, which subclass `nn.Module`, provides the structure for incorporating dynamic routing mechanism between two sub-blocks in a neural network. A dynamic routing algorithm allows a neural network to learn from inputs internally and configure its neurons' connections, thereby allowing the neural network to adapt better to the specific task at hand. This pytorch-based class encapsulates the operations of a dynamic routing block, a higher-level structure in a neural network architecture.

```python
class DynamicRoutingBlock(nn.Module):
```

### Class Definition

Below, you will find the class definition, along with detailed descriptions of its parameters. This gives you a better understanding of the class and circles the logic it follows.

```python
def __init__(self, sb1: nn.Module, sb2: nn.Module, routing_module: nn.Module):
```
*__Parameters__*:

|Parameter | Type | Description |
|--- | --- | --- |
|`sb1` | nn.Module | The first sub-block |
|`sb2` | nn.Module | The second sub-block |
|`routing_module` | nn.Module | The module that computes routing weights|

### Method Definitions
#### Forward Method
This method defines the forward pass of the dynamic routing block. The `routing_weights` are first computed by inputting `x` into the provided routing_module. These weights are then used to compute the final output.

```python
def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
```

*__Parameters__*:

|Parameter | Type | Description |
|--- | --- | --- |
| `x` |    torch.Tensor      | The input tensor|

*__Return__*:

|Type  |Description |
|--- | --- |
|torch.Tensor | The output tensor after dynamic routing |



### Functionality and Usage

To illustrate the usefulness and workings of the `DynamicRoutingBlock`, let's walk through an example.
Suppose you want to create a dynamic routing block that routes between two linear transformation (i.e., `nn.Linear`) sub-blocks, `sb1` and `sb2`, and you have a `routing_module` that computes a sigmoid activation of a dot product with a learnable weight vector.

Firstly, define your two sub-blocks and routing module:

```python
sb1 = nn.Linear(5, 3)
sb2 = nn.Linear(5, 3)


class RoutingModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5))

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(x @ self.weights)


routing_module = RoutingModule()
```

Then, you instantiate your dynamic routing block like this:

```python
drb = DynamicRoutingBlock(sb1, sb2, routing_module)
```

The input can be passed to this block to yield the output:

```python
x = torch.randn(3, 5)
y = drb(x)
```
In the process, the dynamic routing block has learned to route between `sb1` and `sb2` depending on `routing_module`'s weights, allowing the module to discover which sub-block is more 'helpful' for any given input.

Dynamic routing is a powerful tool for allowing a neural network to determine more complex, hierarchical relationships among its inputs. Consequently, using dynamic routing blocks such as described could potentially assist in enhancing the network's predictive performance. The `DynamicRoutingBlock` class provided here provides a simple, yet powerful implementation of such a dynamic routing mechanism.
