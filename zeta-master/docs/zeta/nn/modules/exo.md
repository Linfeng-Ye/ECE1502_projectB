## Exo Activation Function

### Introduction

The Exo activation function is a novel approach to activation functions in deep learning. It combines linear and non-linear parts to adaptively transform input data based on its distribution. This documentation will provide a comprehensive understanding of the Exo activation function.

### Design Philosophy

Exo embodies adaptability, drawing inspiration from the unpredictability of outer space. It dynamically adjusts its transformation based on the input data, making it suitable for multi-modal tasks with diverse data types.

### Mechanism of Operation

Exo operates through a gating mechanism that weighs the influence of linear and non-linear transformations based on the magnitude and distribution of input data. The pseudocode for Exo is as follows:

```python
function Exo(x, alpha):
    gate = sigmoid(alpha * x)
    linear_part = x
    non_linear_part = tanh(x)
    return gate * linear_part + (1 - gate) * non_linear_part
```

### Why Exo Works the Way It Does

Exo's strength lies in its adaptability. The gating mechanism, controlled by the sigmoid function, acts as a switch. For high-magnitude inputs, Exo trends towards a linear behavior, while for lower-magnitude inputs, it adopts a non-linear transformation via the tanh function. This adaptability allows Exo to efficiently handle data heterogeneity, a prominent challenge in multi-modal tasks.

### Ideal Use Cases

Exo is well-suited for various domains:

- **Multi-Modal Data Processing:** Exo's adaptability makes it a strong contender for models handling diverse data types, such as text, image, or audio.

- **Transfer Learning:** The dynamic range of Exo can be beneficial when transferring knowledge from one domain to another.

- **Real-time Data Streams:** In applications where data distributions might change over time, Exo's adaptive nature can offer robust performance.

### Experimental Evaluation

Future research will rigorously evaluate Exo against traditional activation functions across varied datasets and tasks.

### Exo Class

Now, let's explore the Exo class, which implements the Exo activation function.

#### Exo Class Definition

```python
class Exo(nn.Module):
    """
    Exo activation function.

    Parameters:
    - alpha (float): Alpha value for the activation function. Default: 1.0
    """

    def __init__(self, alpha=1.0):
        """INIT function."""
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
        """Forward function."""
        gate = torch.sigmoid(x)
        linear_part = x
        non_linear_part = torch.tanh(x)
        return gate * linear_part + (1 - gate) * non_linear_part
```

#### Example Usage

```python
# Create an Exo instance
exo_activation = Exo(alpha=0.5)

# Apply Exo activation to an input tensor
input_tensor = torch.randn(2)
output_tensor = exo_activation(input_tensor)
```

In the example above, we create an Exo instance with a custom alpha value and apply it to an input tensor. You can adjust the `alpha` parameter to control the adaptability of the Exo activation function to your specific dataset.
