# Module/Class Name: BaseModel

```python
from abc import ABC


class BaseModel(ABC):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass

    def forward(self):
        pass
```

The `BaseModel` serves as a base class for other models, benefiting from the Python feature of inheritance and polymorphism. Designed with the Abstract Base Class (`ABC`), it enforces the subclasses to redefine `forward` method and to provide certain arguments during initialization, thus providing a common API for all subclasses.

## Class Definition

The `BaseModel` class provides the skeleton for the further implementation of any specific model. It does not include any specific model related features but instead enables modularity, creating a structure that is reusable for every type of model desired.

```python
class BaseModel(ABC):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass

    def forward(self):
        pass
```

### Parameters

- **args**: This captures any number of unnamed arguments. You can pass a series of variables or a list of variables, which will be interpreted as a tuple by the method.


- **kwargs**: This is used to pass keyworded, variable-length arguments. With **kwargs, any number of keyword arguments can be used. You can use **kwargs if you do not know the number of keyword arguments that will be passed to the function, or if it is optional to have any keyword arguments at all.

### Method Overview

#### `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs):`

A special method in Python classes, it is called as a constructor in object-oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is instantiated, and necessary initialization can happen here. With *args and **kwargs as parameters, it provides flexibility by handling arbitrary number and type of arguments.

#### `forward(self):`

This is an abstract method that needs to be implemented by any class that extends `BaseModel`. The purpose of the method can change depending on the model, but it is usually used for forward propagation in neural networks.

## Usage

As `BaseModel` is abstract, we cannot directly use it. Instead, we can extend it and implement the required methods in the child class. A typical example of subclassing would be:

```python
class MyModel(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self, number_of_layers):
        self.number_of_layers = number_of_layers
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self):
        # Implement your forward pass here
        ...
```

In this example, the `MyModel` class extends `BaseModel` and overrides the `__init__` and `forward` methods. This way, all the models you implement only need to inherit from the `BaseModel` and implement their specific details.

```python
my_model = MyModel(10)
my_model.forward()
```

In this example, we instantiated an object of the `MyModel` class, passing in the number of layers (10), and then calling `forward` method on it.

## Additional Information

- Consider following Python's [DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) when using inheritance. Instead of writing the same code over and over again for different models, you can put the common elements of all models into a base model.

- As you may have noticed, `BaseModel` adopts an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach to structure the code, making it easier to manage and understand.
