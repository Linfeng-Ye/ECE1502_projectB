# Documentation for SimpleTransformer Class

---


# Introduction

This class provides a concise and efficient implementation for the Transformer model design, designated as `SimpleTransformer` class. The `SimpleTransformer` class is a lean and direct construal of the transformer model that is mainly used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as translation, sentence classification, named entity recognition (NER), among others. 

This model ensures that information flow between distant words is not lost, which is achievable by employing the attention mechanism. This Transformer model is a key part of the architecture used in several state-of-the-art models, including BERT, GPT-2, and T5.

# Class Definition

The class `SimpleTransformer` inherits from the PyTorch `nn.Module` class, which itself is a subclass of the `torch._six.PY3` metaclass. This implementation builds on the abstractions provided by PyTorch to define new modules by subclassing `nn.Module`, and that a model is a big module itself.

# Class Constructor (__init__ method)

The `__init__` method initializes the class instance. It takes seven arguments:

- `self`: This is a common practice in object-oriented programming, and it refers to the object itself. In Python, this is explicitly included as the first parameter. 
- `dim`: This is the dimension of the feature embeddings. Type: int.
- `depth`: This is the depth (i.e., number of layers) of the transformer. Type: int.
- `num_tokens`: This indicates the number of unique tokens in the corpus or vocabulary. Type: int.
- `dim_head`: This is the dimension of a single attention head. Type: int. Default is 64. 
- `heads`: This is the total number of attention heads in the transformer. Type: int. Default is 8.
- `ff_mult`: This is the multiplier for the feed-forward layer's inner layer. Type: int. Default is 4.

The `__init__` method further initializes three attributes:

- `emb`: An instance of PyTorchâ€™s `nn.Embedding` class, which turns integer indexes into dense vectors of fixed size, useful when working with sparse vectors representing categorical data.
- `transformer`: An instance of a Transformer model.
- `to_logits`: This applies a linear transformation to the incoming data, y = xA.T + b, and normalizes samples individually to unit norm.

# Forward Method

The `forward` method defines the forward direction computation of the model.

Arguments:

- `self`: The instance of the class `SimpleTransformer`.
- `x`: The input tensor for the model.

Implementing `forward`: At first, the input tensor `x` is sent through the Embedding layer to convert the input token ids to vectors. This vectorized output is then passed through the transformer layer. `x` finally goes through a linear layer and is returned.

# Example Usage

Here is a simple demonstration on how to create an instance of the `SimpleTransformer` and run a forward pass.

```python
# Import the necessary modules
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn import Transformer

# Sample usage
module = SimpleTransformer(512, 6, 20000)
x = torch.LongTensor(2, 1024).random_(
    0, 20000
)  # creating a 2x1024 matrix of random Longs from 0 to 20000
y = module(x)
print(y.shape)
```

The output tensor size is [2, 1024, 20000], where 20000 represents the number of unique tokens, and [2, 1024] represents the batch size and sequence length, respectively.

Please note: Best Practices for PyTorch include moving tensors and models onto a common device (CPU, CUDA GPU) explicitly.
