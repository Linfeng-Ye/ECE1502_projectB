## Description:

The `maybe` function is a Python decorator that wraps a given function (`fn`) and alters its behavior in such a way that it only calls this function if the first argument provided (`x`) exists. In the context of this decorator, "exists" typically means that `x` is not `None` although this could be adjusted to accommodate any variations on what it means for `x` to "exist" depending on your specific use case.

This type of decorator can be tremendously useful in a number of contexts, including data preprocessing, data validation, error handling, and more.

## Parameters:

| Parameter | Type        | Description                    |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| fn        | function    | The function to be decorated |

## Returns:

| Return    | Type        | Description                    |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| function  | function    | The decorated function |

## Usage Example:

```python
from functools import wraps


def exists(x):
    return x is not None


def maybe(fn):
    @wraps(fn)
    def inner(x, *args, **kwargs):
        if not exists(x):
            return x
        return fn(x, *args, **kwargs)

    return inner


@maybe
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1


print(add_one(None))  # Returns: None
print(add_one(2))  # Returns: 3
```

In this example, we have created a `maybe` decorator using the given `maybe` function and applied it to the `add_one` function. When we call `add_one` with `None` as the argument, the `maybe` decorator checks if `None` exists (which it does not), and so it simply returns `None` without calling the `add_one` function. 

However, when we call `add_one` with `2` as the argument, the `maybe` decorator checks if `2` exists (which it does), and so it proceeds to call the `add_one` function, resulting in `3`.

## Additional Information:

The `maybe` decorator utilises the `@wraps` decorator from the `functools` module which updates the wrapper function to look like the wrapped function. This includes the function name, docstring, and module, amongst other attributes.

The `if not exists(x)` part of the `inner` function acts as a short-circuit evaluation. This means `fn(x, *args, **kwargs)` is not executed if the `x` argument does not exist, thus preventing potential errors or exceptions from occurring.

Please ensure to define an `exists` function according to your requirement, as it works with the `maybe` decorator to determine whether or not the function `fn` should be invoked.
