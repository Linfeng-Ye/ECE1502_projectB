# reshape_img_to_text

## Introduction

The `zeta.ops` library is a collection of utility operations designed to facilitate the manipulation and transformation of tensors, with a particular focus on reshaping and reorganizing data to align the dimensions of image and text tensors—essential processes in multimodal learning systems where different data types are concurrently processed.

This library is crucial for scenarios in which tensors representing different forms of data, such as images and text, must be brought into a compatible shape for batch processing or algorithmic operations. One such function provided by `zeta.ops` is `reshape_img_to_text`, which allows for the seamless transformation of an image tensor to match the size and dimensionality of a text tensor.

Understanding how to leverage the functions within `zeta.ops` requires familiarity with tensor operations and the underlying architecture of multidimensional arrays, as typically used in machine learning and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. This documentation will endeavor to present a comprehensive guide to the `reshape_img_to_text` method.

## reshape_img_to_text Function

The `reshape_img_to_text` function is designed to convert an image tensor shape from a format typically used in convolutional neural networks (B, C, H, W)—where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width—to a format that is conducive for operations commonly performed on text tensors (B, Seqlen, Dimension).

This transformation is pivotal when aligning image data with sequential data, for example, in a multimodal learning context where an algorithm is processing both types of data concurrently.

### Function Definition

```python
def reshape_img_to_text(x: Tensor):
    """
    Reshapes the image tensor to the same size as the text tensor.
    From B, C, H, W to B, Seqlen, Dimension using rearrange.

    Args:
        x (Tensor): The image tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor: The reshaped image tensor.
    """
    # Function implementation
```

### Parameters

| Argument | Type   | Description                                |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| x        | Tensor | The image tensor to be reshaped.           |

### Returns

| Type   | Description                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Tensor | The reshaped tensor matching text data. |

### Usage Example 1

Let's import necessary modules and perform the reshaping of a dummy image tensor:

```python
import torch
from einops import rearrange

from zeta.ops import reshape_img_to_text

# Image tensor with batch size of 2, 3 channels, height of 32 and width of 32
image_tensor = torch.rand(2, 3, 32, 32)

# Reshape image tensor to match text tensor dimensions
reshaped_tensor = reshape_img_to_text(image_tensor)

print(reshaped_tensor.shape)  # Expected: torch.Size([2, 1024, 3])
```

### Usage Example 2

Using the `reshape_img_to_text` function in a machine learning pipeline where image data need to be fed into a sequence model:

```python
# Assume we have a batch of images and corresponding text
batch_images = torch.rand(16, 3, 64, 64)  # dummy image batch tensor
batch_texts = torch.rand(
    16, 128, 512
)  # dummy text batch tensor with a sequence length of 128 and a feature size of 512

# Reshape images to have a compatible sequence length and feature size
batch_images_reshaped = reshape_img_to_text(batch_images)

print(batch_images_reshaped.shape)  # Expected: torch.Size([16, 4096, 3])
```

### Usage Example 3

Integrating the `reshape_img_to_text` function inside a custom neural network class:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

from zeta.ops import reshape_img_to_text


class MultimodalModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Define other layers or modules here

    def forward(self, image, text):
        # Reshape the image to be processed as a sequence
        image_seq = reshape_img_to_text(image)
        # Further processing of image_seq and text
        # ...
        # Return processed data
        return output


# Instantiate the model
model = MultimodalModel()

images = torch.rand(4, 3, 128, 128)
texts = torch.rand(4, 256, 768)

output = model(images, texts)
# The output would be based on how the forward method is defined and what processing is done on image_seq and text
```

## Tips and Additional Information

- The use of the `rearrange` function from `einops` is a key facilitator in the reshaping logic. It allows for a more expressive and error-free tensor manipulation, replacing traditional complex indexing and permute operations.

- Users need to ensure that the dimensions and sizes of the tensors are compatible when passed through models or functions following the `reshape_img_to_text` call.
