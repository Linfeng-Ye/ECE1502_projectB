## Introduction

The `zeta.ops` library is designed to provide a collection of operations and transformations that can be used in the context of neural network development, particularly when working with tensors in frameworks such as PyTorch. One of the operations in this library is `squeeze_2d_new`, which is designed to compress the spatial dimensions of a 2D tensor in a way similar to the `squeeze` operation in PyTorch but with additional capabilities.

This operation changes the shape of an input tensor by aggregating adjacent elements in the height and width dimensions. The purpose is to reduce the spatial dimensionality while increasing the channel dimensionality, thus preserving the tensor's information. This technique is essential in various applications, such as reducing computational complexity or preparing tensors for specific neural network layers that require squeezed input.

In this documentation, we will provide a thorough and explicit guide, complete with examples and usage details, for the `squeeze_2d_new` function within the `zeta.ops` library.

## Function Definition

### squeeze_2d_new(input, factor=2)

Rearranges and compresses the height and width dimensions of the input tensor by the specified factor. This operation effectively pools spatial information into the channel dimension.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type       | Default | Description                                                                                              |
|-----------|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| input     | Tensor     | N/A     | The input tensor with a shape of `(b, c, h, w)`, where `b` is batch size, `c` is channels, `h` is height, and `w` is width. |
| factor    | int        | 2       | The factor by which the height and width dimensions will be reduced. The default value is `2`.           |

## Functionality and Usage

The `squeeze_2d_new` function works by taking a 4-dimensional tensor with dimensions (batch size, channel, height, width) as input and compressing it by a specified factor along both the height and width dimensions. The factor determines how many adjacent elements are combined into one.

The function `rearrange` is used to perform this spatial compression. The rearrangement rule passed to this function specifies that for every `factor` elements along both height and width, a new channel dimension is created, which groups these elements together.

Here's the step-by-step process of how the operation works:

1. The input tensor is considered to have dimensions `(b, c, h, w)`.
2. The `h` and `w` dimensions are subdivided into `factor` segments, resulting in changing the shape to `(b, c, h/factor, factor, w/factor, factor)`.
3. The `factor` segments from `h` and `w` dimensions are flattened into the channel dimension, yielding a new shape of `(b, c*factor^2, h/factor, w/factor)`.
4. The resulting tensor has a reduced height and width by a factor of `factor` but has an increased number of channels by a factor of `factor^2`.

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
import torch
from einops import rearrange

from zeta.ops import squeeze_2d_new

# Assuming zeta.ops has been correctly set up, which includes the function squeeze_2d_new.
# Create a 4D tensor of shape (1, 1, 4, 4), where the batch size and number of channels are both 1,
# the height and width are both 4.

input_tensor = torch.arange(1, 17).view(1, 1, 4, 4)
print("Original tensor:\n", input_tensor)

# Use the squeeze_2d_new function with the default factor
output_tensor = squeeze_2d_new(input_tensor)
print("Squeezed tensor:\n", output_tensor)
```

#### Example 2: Specifying a Different Factor

```python
import torch
from einops import rearrange

from zeta.ops import squeeze_2d_new

# Assume the same setup as above.

# Create a 4D tensor of shape (2, 3, 8, 8) with random floats.
input_tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 8, 8)

# Use the squeeze_2d_new function with a factor of 4
output_tensor = squeeze_2d_new(input_tensor, factor=4)
print("Squeezed tensor with factor=4:\n", output_tensor)
```

#### Example 3: Integration with Neural Network Layer

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from einops import rearrange

from zeta.ops import squeeze_2d_new

# Assume the same setup as above.

# Create a tensor with random data
input_tensor = torch.randn(
    10, 16, 64, 64
)  # 10 samples, 16 channels, 64x64 spatial size

# Define a convolutional layer to process the squeezed tensor
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(
    in_channels=16 * 4 * 4, out_channels=32, kernel_size=1
)  # Adjust in_channels based on the squeezing factor

# Use the squeeze_2d_new function to squeeze input tensor
squeezed_tensor = squeeze_2d_new(input_tensor, factor=4)

# Apply the convolutional layer to the squeezed tensor
output = conv_layer(squeezed_tensor)
print("Output tensor after convolution:\n", output)
```

## Additional Information and Tips

- The `factor` parameter should be chosen such that the resulting dimensions `h/factor` and `w/factor` are integers. If they are not, the function may produce an error or yield an unexpected result.
- This operation is not invertible; i.e., once you squeeze a tensor, you can't recover the original dimensions (height and width) without loss of information.
- When using this function within neural networks, be aware that squeezing can significantly alter the tensor's characteristics and how subsequent layers process it.
