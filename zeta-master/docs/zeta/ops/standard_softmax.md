# standard_softmax

# Module/Function Name: standard_softmax

```python
def standard_softmax(tensor):
    """
    Apply the standard softmax function to an input tensor along the dimension with index 0.

    The softmax function is defined as the normalized exponential function, which is often used to represent a categorical probability distribution.

    Parameters:
    - tensor (torch.Tensor): A PyTorch tensor representing the scores for which softmax should be computed.

    Returns:
    - torch.Tensor: A PyTorch tensor with softmax scores where softmax is applied along the first dimension.

    Example Usage:

    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    # Define a sample tensor
    scores = torch.Tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

    # Compute the softmax scores along the first dimension
    softmax_scores = standard_softmax(scores)
    print(softmax_scores)
    """
    return F.softmax(tensor, dim=0)
```

## Overview

The `standard_softmax` function provides a simple interface for applying the softmax function along the first dimension of a PyTorch tensor. Softmax is an activation function that transforms a vector of real-valued scores into a vector of values that sum up to 1, effectively representing a categorical probability distribution. It is extensively used in deep learning models, especially in multi-class classification tasks where the outputs are interpreted as probabilities.

The `standard_softmax` function is important for creating neural network architectures that classify inputs into multiple categories. It ensures that model predictions translate into a probability distribution over the classes, which is essential for objective functions like the cross-entropy loss commonly used during training.

## Usage and Functionality

To use the `standard_softmax` function, you must first import the necessary modules (`torch` in this case) and define a PyTorch tensor. The input is expected to be any tensor where the softmax operation is desired along the first dimension (dim=0). The dimension could represent various constructs depending on your neural network architecture, such as a batch of scores in a multi-class classification model.

After calling the `standard_softmax` function, the return value will be a PyTorch tensor that has been normalized such that each element can be interpreted as a probability, ensuring that the sum of the scores along the given dimension equals 1.

Below are three extended examples demonstrating different scenarios in which `standard_softmax` could be used, including its implementation within a neural network model for classification purposes.

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

from zeta.ops import standard_softmax

# Example tensor holding scores for 3 different classes
scores = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Compute softmax scores
softmax_scores = standard_softmax(scores)

print("Softmax Scores:", softmax_scores)
# Output will be a tensor with probabilities summing to 1.
```

### Example 2: Applying Softmax to a 2D Tensor Representing Batch Data

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

from zeta.ops import standard_softmax

# Example batch of tensors where each sub-tensor is a score vector for an instance
batch_scores = torch.tensor([[2.0, 1.5, 0.5], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [3.0, 2.0, 1.0]])

# Compute the softmax scores for the batch
batch_softmax_scores = standard_softmax(batch_scores)

print("Batch Softmax Scores:", batch_softmax_scores)
# Each row will have softmax applied, producing a batch of probability distributions.
```

### Example 3: Using Standard Softmax in a Neural Network Model

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.autograd import Variable

from zeta.ops import standard_softmax


# Define a simple neural network model with an output layer including softmax
class SimpleNeuralNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(
            10, 3
        )  # Maps from an input dimension of 10 to 3 classes

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        return standard_softmax(x)


# Instantiate the neural network
model = SimpleNeuralNet()

# Example input for the model
input_data = Variable(torch.randn(1, 10))  # Single instance with 10 features

# Forward pass through the model with softmax at the output layer
output_probabilities = model(input_data)

print("Output Probabilities:", output_probabilities)
# Output will be a tensor representing probabilities for 3 classes
```

## Additional Tips

- When implementing `standard_softmax` on a batch of data, keep in mind that the function applies softmax independently to each vector along the first dimension, not to the entire batch at once.
- For numerical stability, it is often not necessary to explicitly call the softmax function before computing the cross-entropy loss, as PyTorch's `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` combines log softmax and NLL loss in a single step.
- Always verify the dimensionality of your tensors when using softmax, as incorrect dimensions can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
