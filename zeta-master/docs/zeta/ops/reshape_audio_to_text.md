# reshape_audio_to_text


## Introduction to zeta.ops

The `zeta.ops` library is a Python module aimed at providing specialized operations and utilities critically relevant to handling and manipulating tensors, particularly for audio and text related tasks in machine learning applications. The core functionality of this library is to assist in reshaping tensors in a way that they become compatible for further processes such as alignment, joint representation, or further computational graphs commonly found in neural network architectures.

## Purpose of `reshape_audio_to_text`

The `reshape_audio_to_text` function within the `zeta.ops` library is designed to reshape an audio tensor to match the size of a corresponding text tensor. This function is crucial in applications where alignment between different modalities, such as audio and text, is required. For instance, in sequence-to-sequence models, such as speech recognition, where the audio (acoustic signal) needs to be aligned with text (transcription), matching the dimensions of tensors representing these modalities is essential for proper processing by neural networks.

## How `reshape_audio_to_text` Works

The function `reshape_audio_to_text` utilizes the `rearrange` operation to reshape a 3-dimensional audio tensor from the shape (Batch, Channel, Time) to (Batch, Sequence Length, Dimension), allowing it to be in a compatible shape with the corresponding text tensor.

## Function Definition

```python
from einops import rearrange
from torch import Tensor


def reshape_audio_to_text(x: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """
    Reshapes the audio tensor to the same size as the text tensor.
    From B, C, T to B, Seqlen, Dimension using rearrange.

    Args:
        x (Tensor): The audio tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor: The reshaped audio tensor.
    """
    b, c, t = x.shape
    out = rearrange(x, "b c t -> b t c")
    return out
```

### Parameters and Return Types

| Parameter | Type   | Description                  |
|-----------|--------|------------------------------|
| x         | Tensor | The input audio tensor.      |

| Returns | Type   | Description                     |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------|
| out     | Tensor | The reshaped audio tensor.      |

### Functionality and Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
import torch
from einops import rearrange

from zeta.ops import reshape_audio_to_text

# Create a dummy audio tensor of shape (Batch, Channel, Time)
audio_tensor = torch.randn(1, 2, 50)

# Reshape the audio tensor to match the text tensor shape
reshaped_audio = reshape_audio_to_text(audio_tensor)

# Output the reshaped tensor
print(reshaped_audio.shape)  # Expected output: torch.Size([1, 50, 2])
```

#### Example 2: Integrating with a Model

Assuming we have a model that requires the audio tensor to be reshaped before processing, we can utilize `reshape_audio_to_text` as a preprocessing step.

```python
import torch
from einops import rearrange

from zeta.ops import reshape_audio_to_text


class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Define model layers here

    def forward(self, audio, text):
        audio = reshape_audio_to_text(audio)
        # Perform further operations with audio and text
        # ...


# Instantiate the model
model = Model()

# Create dummy audio and text tensors
audio_tensor = torch.randn(1, 2, 50)
text_tensor = torch.randn(1, 50, 2)

# Forward pass
output = model(audio_tensor, text_tensor)
```

#### Example 3: Collaborative Filtering between Modalities

In some applications, we might need to perform operations that require the collaboration between different modalities after aligning their dimensions.

```python
import torch
from einops import rearrange

from zeta.ops import reshape_audio_to_text

# Create dummy tensors for audio and text
audio_tensor = torch.randn(1, 2, 50)
text_tensor = torch.randn(1, 50, 2)

# Reshape the audio tensor to match the text tensor shape
audio_tensor_reshaped = reshape_audio_to_text(audio_tensor)

# Perform some collaborative filtering
result = audio_tensor_reshaped + text_tensor  # Element-wise addition

# Output the result
print(result.shape)  # Expected output: torch.Size([1, 50, 2])
```

### Additional Information and Tips

- The `rearrange` function from the `einops` library is used for tensor reshaping. It's a powerful tool for multi-dimensional tensor manipulation and should be understood for custom operations.
- Ensuring the tensor shape compatibility before reshaping is critical to avoid runtime errors. Make sure the dimensions to be transposed correspond with the desired shape properly.
- The shape (Batch, Sequence Length, Dimension) is tailored for typical sequence processing tasks such as sequence-to-sequence models, attention mechanisms, and recurrent neural networks.
