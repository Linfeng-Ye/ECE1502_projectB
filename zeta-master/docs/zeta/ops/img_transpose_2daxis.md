# img_transpose_2daxis

The `img_transpose_2daxis` function is designed for transposing two-dimensional image arrays across width and height while retaining the color channels in their original order. This operation is common in image processing tasks where the format of the image needs to be adjusted without altering its color representation. Below, we will explore the architecture of the `img_transpose_2daxis` function and provide thorough explanations, usage examples, and valuable insights for effective utilization.

## Introduction

In many computer vision applications and neural networks that involve images, it is often required to manipulate the dimensions of image tensors for compatibility with various algorithms and library requirements. For instance, some image processing libraries expect images in `(height, width, channels)` format, while others operate on `(width, height, channels)`. The `img_transpose_2daxis` code snippet provides a simple yet versatile function that can switch between these two spatial layouts.

Understanding the function's architecture is straightforward as it utilizes the `rearrange` function from the `einops` library--a powerful tool for tensor manipulation that provides more readable and expressive tensor operations.

## Function Definition

```python
def img_transpose_2daxis(x):
    return rearrange(x, "h w c -> w h c")
```

| Parameter | Type  | Description                               |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| x         | Tensor | The input image tensor of shape `(h, w, c)` |

The function `img_transpose_2daxis` accepts a single argument `x`, which is expected to be a tensor or a multi-dimensional array representing an image. The dimension order of `x` is assumed to be `(height, width, channels)`.

## Functionality and Usage

The `img_transpose_2daxis` function works by utilizing the `rearrange` functionality to transpose the first two dimensions of an image tensor. Here's what happens step-by-step:

1. The function takes an input image tensor `x` assumed to have the shape `(height, width, channels)`.
2. The `rearrange` function is called with a pattern that specifies how the dimensions should be reordered. In this case, `h w c -> w h c` translates to "take the height and width dimensions and switch their order while keeping the channel dimension as is."
3. The function returns the reorganized tensor.

### Example 1: Basic Usage

First, install the required `einops` library:

```bash
pip install einops
```

Then, use the function in a Python script:

```python
import torch
from einops import rearrange

from zeta.ops import img_transpose_2daxis

# Create a dummy image tensor with shape (height, width, channels)
img_tensor = torch.rand(100, 200, 3)  # Example Tensor of shape (100, 200, 3)

# Transpose the 2D axis of the image tensor
transposed_img = img_transpose_2daxis(img_tensor)

print("Original shape:", img_tensor.shape)
print("Transposed shape:", transposed_img.shape)
```

### Example 2: Using with Image Data

Let's say you're working with image data loaded using the PIL library:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

from zeta.ops import img_transpose_2daxis

# Open an image using PIL and convert it to a NumPy array
image = Image.open("path_to_your_image.jpg")
img_array = np.array(image)

# Assuming the image array has a shape (height, width, channels)
print("Original shape:", img_array.shape)

# Transpose the 2D axis using our function
transposed_img_array = img_transpose_2daxis(img_array)

print("Transposed shape:", transposed_img_array.shape)
```

### Example 3: Integration with PyTorch DataLoader

If you are using `img_transpose_2daxis` as part of a data preprocessing pipeline in PyTorch:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import transforms

from zeta.ops import img_transpose_2daxis

# Define a custom transform using Lambda
transpose_transform = transforms.Lambda(img_transpose_2daxis)

# Compose this with other transforms
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transpose_transform])

# Use the composed transforms in your dataset loader
train_loader = DataLoader(
    your_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, transform=transform
)

# Now, when the images from train_loader are accessed, they will already be transposed
```

## Additional Information and Tips

- As `img_transpose_2daxis` relies on `rearrange` from the `einops` library, ensure that `einops` is installed and properly working in your environment.
- Be cautious about the input dimensions. If you input a tensor with incorrect dimensions (other than `(height, width, channels)`), the function might return unexpected results or raise an error.
- The function is flexible and can be easily integrated with various image preprocessing pipelines and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
