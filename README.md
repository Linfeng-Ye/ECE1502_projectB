In the first part of this project, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Mamba model and its key innovations, highlighting its major technical contributions and the improvements it introduces over existing approaches. We examine how the Mamba model addresses current challenges in sequence modeling by incorporating features like the selection mechanism and hardware-aware algorithms, which enhance its efficiency, scalability, and overall performance.

Following this exploration, we propose three potential directions for further extending the Mamba model's capabilities. Each extension builds on the model's foundational principles, aiming to improve its performance, broaden its applicability, or address specific limitations. To demonstrate the feasibility of these extensions, we present preliminary results from one of them, offering valuable insights into the potential impact of the proposed ideas. These initial findings lay the groundwork for future research and development, highlighting Mambaâ€™s potential to drive advancements in the field of deep learning.
